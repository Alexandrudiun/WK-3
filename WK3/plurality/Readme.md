# README
This is a program that implements a plurality voting system, which allows voters to cast a vote for their preferred candidate.
The program takes in a list of candidates as command line arguments and prompts the user for the number of voters. It then asks each voter to enter the 
name of their preferred candidate. The program counts the votes for each candidate and determines the winner(s) by printing the name(s) of the candidate(s)
with the most votes.
